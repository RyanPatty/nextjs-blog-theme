title: Project Description
description: " In this project we are conducting research on our design questions in an attempt to improve the ways that designers and developers work together regarding design consistency and creativity. Example, there are two teams working on the frontend of a software project and they each have some unique ideas that could benefit the overall project. How do we integrate those new ideas while still maintaining a consistent design throughout the application."
