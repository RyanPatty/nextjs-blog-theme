# Team Name: Aces in Eight

**Team #8 Members**: Phone Tun, Ryan Oâ€™Connor

## Project Title: Consistency and Creativity

### Deliverable #2

## User Analysis

### 1. User Classes:

**UX/UI Designers**: These professionals are primarily concerned with the user experience and the user interface of a product. They focus on making interfaces beautiful and easy to use.

**Graphic Designers**: These individuals specialize in creating visual concepts that inspire, inform, and captivate consumers. They develop the overall layout and production design for various applications.

**System Designers**: These professionals design systems, services, and processes. They ensure that all parts of a system interact with each other effectively and efficiently.

### 2. User Characteristics:

**UX/UI Designers**: Typically, they have a good understanding of user-centered design principles, wireframing and prototyping tools, and have excellent visual design skills.

**Graphic Designers**: They generally possess strong creative skills, an excellent eye for detail, and proficiency in design software like Adobe Creative Suite.

**System Designers**: They are strategic thinkers with a strong understanding of system architectures, technical concepts, and system interfaces. They are able to conceptualize and design complex systems and ensure seamless interaction between different components.

### 3. User Stories:

**UX/UI Designer**: "Maintaining design consistency is crucial to me as it greatly affects the user experience. However, it's equally important to introduce creative elements to make the design stand out. The challenge is to strike a balance between the two."

**Graphic Designer**: "In my work, creativity is paramount. However, I understand the importance of consistency, especially when working on a brand's identity. It's a delicate dance between bringing fresh ideas and maintaining a recognizable and consistent image."

**System Designer**: "While my work is less about visual design and more about system functionality, consistency still plays a significant role. We need to ensure different parts of a system work coherently. At the same time, creative problem-solving is crucial when designing complex systems."

### Work Environment Observation:
If observing these users in their work environments, you might notice that each uses specialized software to conduct their tasks. They often work in teams and frequently communicate with other stakeholders, especially when it comes to ensuring design consistency. Regular meetings might occur to discuss design principles, system interfaces, user feedback, and the progress of ongoing projects.

## Task Analysis

### Task #1: Literature Review

**Goal**: The goal is to increase our understanding of design and collaboration exploring our research questions from deliverable 1.

**Sub-Tasks**:
1. Identify relevant databases and search engines for design-related literature.
2. Find literature by using search terms and criteria related to the research questions.
3. Analyze the literature, extract some data, and report our findings.

**Preconditions**: Access to academic databases and scholarly articles is required. Familiarity with systematic literature review processes is needed.

**Exceptions**: Limited access to certain databases or papers might hinder the depth of the literature review. Lack of previous research on the topic might limit the available sources.

**Time constraints**: The time taken for a literature review can vary significantly based on the volume of available literature and the complexity of the topic. It might take several weeks to a few months.

**Frequency of use**: This task is done once at the start of the research process but can be revisited as new literature emerges.

### Task #2: Data Collection

**Goal

**: To gather primary data from professional designers about their experiences, challenges, and strategies in balancing creativity and consistency in their design work.

**Sub-Tasks**:
1. Identify the target population for data collection (e.g., professional designers, design firms).
2. Design data collection instruments (e.g., survey questionnaire, interview protocol).
3. Conduct data collection (e.g., distribute surveys, conduct interviews).
4. Analyze the data and report the findings.

**Preconditions**: Access to the target population is necessary. Knowledge of data collection and analysis methods is required.

**Exceptions**: Non-responsiveness or low response rate from the target population might impact the data quality. Privacy concerns might limit the extent of information shared by respondents.

**Time constraints**: Depending on the size of the target population and the mode of data collection, this task might take several weeks to a few months.

**Frequency of use**: This task is typically done once after the literature review but can be repeated if more data is needed.

### Task #3: Case Study Analysis

**Goal**: The goal is to understand how design and collaboration happens by learning from real scenarios.

**Sub-Tasks**:
1. Identify successful design projects that effectively balance consistency and creativity.
2. Collect information and materials from the studies (design plans, design iterations, user feedback).
3. Analyze the projects and report the findings (design process, strategies used, challenges encountered, outcomes, etc.).

**Preconditions**: Access to information from previous design projects is required. Skills in case study analysis would help.

**Exceptions**: Some design projects might have confidentiality issues or lack detailed documentation, making it difficult to conduct an in-depth analysis.

**Time constraints**: Depending on the number and complexity of the case studies, this task might take several weeks to a few months.

**Frequency of use**: This task is typically done once after data collection but can be repeated with different case studies if necessary.
